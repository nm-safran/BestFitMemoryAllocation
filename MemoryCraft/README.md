# BestFitAlgorithm

This project demonstrates the implementation of the Best Fit Algorithm in memory allocation using React and Vite. It includes an interactive simulation with a graphical user interface.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Features
- Interactive visualization of memory allocation algorithms
- Simple and user-friendly React-based interface
- Fast and responsive thanks to Vite's optimized development server

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`.
